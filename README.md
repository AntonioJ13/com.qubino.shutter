# com.qubino.shutter
Homey Qubino shutter app

## Supported modules

This app currently only supports the ZMNHOD1 module (Flush Shutter DC)

## NOTES

This is a seperated qubino driver to be able to be us in conjunction with the original homey qubino app.
Currently there seems to be issues with ZMNHOD1 with newer firmware then **S1**

Confirmed working firmwares are: 

* H1**S1**P1

When Athom and Qubino fix the current zwave/firmware issues, this driver will be merged back into the official app.
